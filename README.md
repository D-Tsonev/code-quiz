# Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Overview

This project aims to create a timed coding quiz web application for testing JavaScript fundamentals. The application provides a clean and responsive user interface, dynamically updating content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to assess their knowledge through multiple-choice questions and records their scores.


## Instructions

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears

  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
  

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

 ## Current State (Unfinished)

Start Button and Questions: The project initiates by presenting a start button. Clicking the button starts the quiz timer and displays the first question.

Feedback on Answers: Users receive immediate feedback on the correctness of their answers. The quiz progresses to the next question or deducts time for incorrect answers.

Quiz Completion: The quiz concludes either when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0.

## Missing Functionality

Saving User Initials and Scores: The current state does not include functionality for saving user initials and displaying their scores. 

The project currently logs the score in the console but lacks a mechanism to save this data for user reference.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and additional features, such as saving user data and enhancing the user interface, are planned for future development.
